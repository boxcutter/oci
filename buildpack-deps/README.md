# buildpack-deps

In spirit, `buildpack-deps` is similar to [Heroku's stack images](https://github.com/heroku/stack-images/). It includes a large number of "development header" packages needed by various things like Ruby Gems, PyPI modules, etc. For example, `buildpack-deps` would let you do a `bundle install` in an arbitrary application directory without knowing beforehand that `ssl.h` is required to build a dependent module.

This image repackages the container images defined in https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps because we remix some images that use this as a dependency. We also are specific about the exact base ubuntu image we depend on. The upstream images use a generic label, so it's difficult to tell.

# How to use this image

This stack is designed to be the foundation of a language-stack image.

## What's inlcuded?

The main tags of this image are the full batteries-included approach. With them, a majority of arbitrary `gem install` / `npm install` / `pip install` should be successful without additional header/development packages.

For some language stacks, that doesn't make sense, particularly if linking to arbitrary external C libraries is much less common (as in Go and Java, for example), which is where these other smaller variants can come in handy.

### curl

This variant includes just the `curl`, `wget`, and `ca-certificates` packages. This is perfect for cases like the Java JRE, where downloading JARs is very common and necessary, but checking out code isn't.

### scm

This variant is based on `curl`, but also adds various source control management tools. As of this writing, the current list of included tools is `bzr`, `git`, `hg`, and `svn`. Intentionally missing is `cvs` due to the dwindling relevance it has (sorry CVS). This image is perfect for cases like the Java JDK, where downloading JARs is very common (hence the curl base still), but checking out code also becomes more common as well (compared to the JRE).
