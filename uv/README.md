# uv

This image repackages uv releases from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases

This image is based on https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/Dockerfile

A distroless Docker image is provided, which is useful for copying uv binaries
into your own image builds. The distroless images do not contain anything
but the uv binaries.
